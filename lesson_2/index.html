					<p title="Attention!!!" id="selection-1">
						Ferrari S.p.A. is an Italian company producing sports and racing cars, based in Maranello. Founded in 1947

						sponsored racing drivers and produced racing cars until 1947. Since 1947, it began producing sports cars

					<h2>Emblem</h2>
					<img src="/img/3.jpg" alt="">
					<p id="selection-2">
						The Ferrari emblem - a prancing stallion on a yellow background - first appeared on printed materials and
						official company documents in 1929. However, at that time, the Prancing Stallion was not depicted on the
						cars, as they belonged to Alfa Romeo and had their own logo in the form of a cloverleaf on a white
						triangular background. The image of a prancing horse was not unique then - for example, since the 1860s it
						was on steam equipment (locomotives and rollers) of the British company Aveling and <br>Enzo Ferrari wrote
						in his memoirs: <br>“As a factory mark, I continued to use the image of a rearing horse, which I first
						appeared on Scuderia Ferrari cars. The story of this rearing horse is simple and funny. Francesco Baracca
						carried this emblem on his fighter plane from the First World War. He was shot down near Montello. When I
						competed at the Circuito del Savio in Ravenna in 1923, I met Count Enrico Baracca, the father of the hero.
						He introduced me to his wife, Countess Paolina Baracca, who one day suggested: Ferrari, why don’t you depict
						my son’s rearing horse on your racing car? He will bring you good luck.I still keep a photograph of the ace
						with a dedication from his parents, in which they entrust me with this sign with a horse. The horse was and
						remains black. I added a golden background, which is the color of the city of Modena.” <br>The Scuderia
						Ferrari emblem looks like a triangular shield, and the Ferrari plant logo looks like a rectangle, with a
						striped ribbon of the Italian flag.

					<h2 id="selection-4">Vehicle history</h2>
					<h3>1930—1950</h3>
					<img src="/img/5.jpg" alt="">
					<p>
						The company (its original name was Auto Avio Costruzioni) was founded in 1929 by racer, designer and tester
						of Alfa Romeo cars Enzo Ferrari. Initially, it produced various equipment for cars. The cars made by the
						company were produced under the Alfa Romeo brand. Ferrari had an agreement with this company. The first car
						bearing the actual name “Ferrari” appeared in 1946. It was the Ferrari 125 model, with a powerful
						12-cylinder aluminum engine, designed to realize the dream of its creator: to give an ordinary road car
						racing properties without sacrificing comfort. Enzo Ferrari chose a prancing stallion on a yellow background
						as the company's trademark. <br>By the end of 1947, there were already two modifications of the Ferrari
						engine, and its displacement increased in the 166 model from 1496 to 1995 cm³. The following year, Ferrari's
						own team won the Mille Miglia and Targa Florio races for the first time. 1949 brought the team another
						triumph in the same competition, and a little later a victory in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
					</p>
					<h3>1950—1960</h3>
					<img src="/img/6.jpg" alt="">
					<p>
						In 1951, the milestone model 340 America appeared with an engine originally developed for the Ferrari GT
						with a displacement of 4.1 liters. In 1953, the same car was equipped with a 4.5-liter engine and received a
						new name - 375 America. In the same year, Ferrari introduced the 250 Europa, with a three-liter engine.
						<br>In total, by the beginning of 1954, Enzo Ferrari had produced about 200 of his cars in an exclusive road
						version and 250 racing models. When creating his road cars, Ferrari turned to different design companies,
						making their models different from each other. But the 1954 250 GT marked the beginning of a long-term and
						fruitful collaboration with Pininfarina, which perfectly matched its bodies to the new short-wheelbase
						chassis, in which the drive rear axle was suspended on springs. <br>1958 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder
						<br>The 250 GT model was already produced not only as a coupe, but also as a convertible, and the
						custom-made 250 GT California, which appeared in 1959, is a striking example of the open sports-type 250 GT
						model. In 1958, Pininfarina created a body for the 250 GT model with a specifically angular shape: these
						cars, equipped with a 12-cylinder engine, externally gave the impression of enormous power, ideally obedient
						to any desires of their owners. <br>The 375 America and the 410 Super America that replaced it in 1956 (only
						14 of them were produced) were intended for the “powers that be”: their design evoked a feeling of strength
						and self-confidence. <br>From 1957 to 1962, a modified Ferrari 250 GT California was produced with a
						predatory pointed profile and a removable roof. This car scored its first victory in the 1960 Tourist Trophy
						race at Goodwood Circuit.
					</p>
					<h3>1960—1970</h3>
					<img src="/img/7.jpg" alt="">
					<p>
						Ferrari owns the most memorable cars of the 60s of the XX century: the 250 GT in 1960 was transformed into
						the 250 GTE fastback with a “2+2” body, elegant and popular, on the basis of which the 330 GT “2+2” was
						created in 1964 four-liter engine and original “squinting” headlights. From 1962 to 1964, one of the most
						significant cars in history, the 250 GTO (“Gran Turismo Omologata”), was built on the basis of the 250 GT. A
						total of 39 cars were produced with a 3-liter V12 engine producing 300 hp. s., having a 5-speed gearbox. The
						weight of the car was 1100 kg, the wheelbase was 2400 mm, and the maximum speed was more than 283 km/h.
						<br>Subsequently, in 2013, a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO was sold for a record $52 million, making it the most
						expensive car in the world. <br>The feminine, graceful, swift Berlinetta Lusso of 1962, reaching speeds of
						over 225 km/h, remains unsurpassed. The 330 GT “2+2” was replaced in 1967 by the 365 GT “2+2” with
						self-balancing rear suspension and power steering. In 1971 it was replaced by the 365 GT4, which was more
						austere in keeping with the spirit of the times. <br>In 1966, the company developed a new V-engine, derived
						from racing engines: a 12-cylinder, four-cam, with two camshafts in each cylinder head, a dry sump
						lubrication system, providing high torque and flexibility, with a power of 300 hp. With. <br>Ferrari
						DaytonaIn 1968, Ferrari released the legendary Daytona, or 365 GTB/4, with a front-mounted 4.4-liter V-12
						engine producing 352 horsepower. with., developing super speed - 282 km/h. This model is outwardly discreet
						and functional.
					</p>
					<h3>1970—1990</h3>
					<img src="/img/8.jpg" alt="">
					<p>
						In the early 1970s, the “Dino” model appeared, named after Commendatore’s deceased son, with a centrally
						located FIAT V-6-cylinder engine; The model was also produced in an 8-cylinder version, but the 6-cylinder
						model is considered a classic. At one time, Dino was actually a separate brand. The Dino-206 GT car has been
						produced since 1967 with a V6 engine (1987 cm3 180 hp at 8000 rpm; since 1969 - “246 GT” - 2418 cm3, 195 hp
						at 7600 rpm ). Exactly the same engines, unconventional for Ferrari, were installed on the sports Fiat Dino.
						<br>The 365 GT4, or Berlinetta Boxer, produced in 1971, had many features of Ferrari racing cars: its
						4.4-liter engine could reach a speed of 275 km/h; it was located horizontally in the middle of the body, and
						the gearbox for more efficient use The internal volume of the body was located under the engine. The chassis
						also used the experience of racing cars: a tubular space frame and steel body panels. Based on the Ferrari
						308 GT4, elegant models were made with Pininfarina bodies; equipped with V-shaped 8-cylinder engines, they
						attracted the attention of buyers until early 80s. <br>Ferrari TestarossaBy installing the horizontal
						12-cylinder Boxer racing engine 512 BB in the Testarossa, the company created a massive, heavy machine that
						meets the most demanding requirements of both sports racers and celebrity clients. The bright, eye-catching
						design of Pininfarin carried the quintessence of the advertising spirit, and its creator sought not only an
						external effect: ribbed side air intakes, which found many imitators, served to supply air to the side
						radiators, replacing the front radiator 512 BB. The technical performance of the model was also impeccable:
						the five-liter Testarossa engine, with four valves per cylinder, reached a power of 390 hp. s., and its
						maximum speed is 274 km/h. <br>Ferrari F40In 1987, the founder of the company, Enzo Ferrari, headed the team
						of designers who prepared the F40 model, designated as “the sum of the company’s efforts over the years of
						its existence.” The F40 dates back to the 1984 GTO and, at first glance, has much in common with the Ferrari
						308 GTB, but has significant technical innovations: turbocharging, a V-shaped 8-cylinder longitudinal
						(rather than transverse) engine mounted on a tubular frame, reinforced with Kevlar load-bearing panels,
						super power 478 hp. With. - everything suggests that only the configuration remains the same. The body of
						this supermodel is made of carbon fiber and Kevlar, and its cramped interior fully corresponds to the sporty
						essence of the car: it does not even have a mechanism for adjusting the seats. Amazing technical performance
						and no comfort - that’s the motto of the 1118-kilogram Ferrari F40: the rigid suspension did not absorb road
						irregularities, the steering responded to every pothole, and the magnificent engine demonstrated endless
						power. Demanding, uncontrollably energetic and attractive - this was the latest brainchild of the company’s
						founder. <br>Ferrari cars, controlled by FIAT since 1969 and finally transferred to the corporation in 1989,
						have a reputation as the most expensive in the world. Each of them is a legend.
