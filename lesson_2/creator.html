			Enzo Ferrari was born in Modena, Italy, according to his own words, on February 18, 1898[1]. Enzo Ferrari's birth
			certificate states that he was born on February 20, 1898 in Modena, and the birth was registered on February 24,
			1898 because a severe snowstorm prevented his father from reporting the birth to the local civil registry
			office.[2] Enzo's father's name was Alfredo Ferrari, and his mother's name was Adalgisa Bisbini. They had two
			children - Enzo and his older brother Alfredo, named after his father. His father was the son of a grocer from
			Carpi and founded a workshop for the manufacture of metal parts in the family home[3]. Enzo grew up with little
			education. As a child, he dreamed of becoming an opera singer or sports journalist[4]. At the age of 10, his
			father took him to the 1908 racing competition in Bologna, and Feliz Nazzaro's victory inspired him to become a
			racing driver.[5] During World War I he served in the 3rd Mountain Artillery Regiment of the Italian Army. In
			1916, his father and older brother died as a result of a widespread outbreak of Italian influenza. According to
			other information, the brother died at the front[4]. Ferrari himself became seriously ill in 1918 during the
			Spanish flu epidemic and was removed from service[6]. <br>After demobilization and the collapse of the family's
			business, Enzo began looking for work in the automobile industry. He tried to get a job at Fiat in Turin, which
			was rejected, and ended up getting a job as a test driver at the C.M.N. plant. (Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali)
			in Milan[7], which converted used truck bodies into small passenger cars. He was later promoted to racing driver
			and made his debut in 1919 at Parma Poggio di Berceto, where he finished fourth in a 2.3-liter 4-cylinder C.M.N.
			15/20. On November 23, he competed in the Targa Florio race, but was forced to retire after his car's fuel tank
			developed a fuel leak.[8] <br>In 1920, Enzo joined Alfa Romeo's racing department as a driver. In 1924, Ferrari
			won the Coppa Acerbo in Pescara, after which Alfa Romeo invited him to participate in much more prestigious
			competitions[9]. Deeply shocked by the death of Antonio Ascari in 1925, Ferrari, by his own admission, continued
			racing half-heartedly. After the birth of his son Dino in 1932, Ferrari decided to retire from racing and
			concentrate on managing and developing Alfa's factory racing cars, creating a racing team including Giuseppe
			Campari and Tazio Nuvolari, the Scuderia Ferrari ("Ferrari Stable") in 1929. As the racing division of Alfa Romeo,
			the team achieved great success with excellent cars such as the Alfa Romeo P3 and talented drivers such as
			Nuvolari.[10] <br>During this period, a racing emblem with a horse began to appear on his team's cars. According
			to the version told by Ferrari himself, when he met Countess Paola Baracca - the mother of the famous Francesco
			Baracca, the main ace pilot of Italy - she invited him to use the rearing horse, invented by her son, as an
			emblem, in memory of him. Ferrari began to use it only nine years later. According to another version, the emblem
			was taken from a German plane that was shot down by Francesco; the horse is a symbol of Stuttgart, where the
			downed pilot was from[11]. <br>Alfa Romeo agreed to cooperate with the Ferrari racing team until 1933, after which
			financial difficulties forced them to withdraw support - a decision that was later reversed thanks to the
			intervention of Pirelli. Despite the quality of the Scuderia's drivers, the team struggled with Auto Union and
			Mercedes. Although German manufacturers dominated the era, the Ferrari team achieved a notable victory in 1935
			when Tazio Nuvolari beat Rudolf Caracciola and Bernd Rosemeier at the German Grand Prix.[12] <br>In 1937, Scuderia
			Ferrari was dissolved and Enzo became head of Alfa Romeo's racing team, Alfa Corse. Alfa Romeo has decided to
			regain full control of its racing division, retaining its position as Ferrari's sporting director. After
			disagreements with Alfa Romeo managing director Ugo Gobbato, Ferrari left in 1939 and founded Auto-Avio
			Costruzioni, supplying parts to other racing teams. The first car produced under the Ferrari name was the Ferrari
			125. Although a clause in the contract limited his right to race and design cars for four years, Ferrari managed
			to produce two cars for the Thousand Miles in 1940, driven by Alberto Ascari and Lothario Rangoni. With the
			outbreak of World War II in 1940, the Ferrari factory was forced to begin war production for Mussolini's fascist
			government. After the Allied bombing of the factory, Ferrari moved from Modena to Maranello. At the end of the
			conflict, Enzo decided to start producing cars bearing his name, and in 1947 he founded Ferrari S.p.A.[13]. The
			company's first model was the 125 GT, followed by the 125S, 159S and 166. <br>Enzo decided to fight the then
			dominant Alfa Romeo and
